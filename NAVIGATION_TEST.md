# 🧪 Navigation Testing Guide

## 🔍 Testing the Homepage Navigation

### **Current Navigation Structure:**
```
📱 App Flow:
├── app/index.tsx (Homepage - Entry Point)
│   ├── "Sign Up Free" → /(tabs) 
│   ├── "Login" → /(tabs)
│   ├── "Continue as Guest" → /(tabs)
│   └── Feature Cards → /(tabs) (working features)
│
└── app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx (Expense Tracker)
    ├── Back Button → / (Homepage)
    ├── Tab 1: Expense Tracker
    └── Tab 2: Analytics
```

## 🐛 **Testing Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Homepage to Expense Tracker**
1. **Open app** → Should show homepage with gradient header
2. **Tap "Continue as Guest"** → Should navigate to expense tracker
3. **Check console** → Should see: `👤 Guest mode - navigating to expense tracker`

### **Step 2: Test Back Navigation** 
1. **In expense tracker** → Look for back button in header (arrow + "Home" text)
2. **Tap back button** → Should return to homepage
3. **Check console** → Should see: `🔙 Back button pressed - navigating to homepage`

### **Step 3: Test Feature Cards**
1. **On homepage** → Tap "Personal Expenses" card
2. **Should navigate** to expense tracker
3. **Check console** → Should see: `🚀 Navigating to: /(tabs) for Personal Expenses`

### **Step 4: Test All Buttons**
- ✅ **"Sign Up Free"** → Expense tracker
- ✅ **"Login"** → Expense tracker  
- ✅ **"Continue as Guest"** → Expense tracker
- ✅ **Personal Expenses card** → Expense tracker
- ✅ **Budget Management card** → Expense tracker
- ✅ **Analytics card** → Expense tracker
- 🔜 **Coming Soon cards** → Should be disabled

## 🔧 **Debugging Console Messages:**

### **Expected Console Output:**
```

👤 Guest mode - navigating to expense tracker

// When tapping auth buttons:
🔐 Auth action: register - navigating to expense tracker
🔐 Auth action: login - navigating to expense tracker

// When tapping feature cards:
🚀 Navigating to: /(tabs) for Personal Expenses

// When tapping back button:
🔙 Back button pressed - navigating to homepage

// When tapping coming soon features:

```

## 🎯 **What Should Work:**

### **✅ Working Navigation:**
- Homepage loads with beautiful gradient
- All buttons navigate to expense tracker
- Back button returns to homepage
- Console shows debugging messages
- Feature cards respond correctly

### **❌ If Back Button Doesn't Work:**

**Possible Issues:**
1. **Router not working** → Check expo-router installation
2. **Navigation stack issue** → Check _layout.tsx structure
3. **Button not pressable** → Check TouchableOpacity props

**Debug Steps:**
1. **Check console** → Should see back button message
2. **Try router.back()** → Alternative navigation method
3. **Check canGoBack()** → Verify navigation history

## 🚀 **Run the Test:**

```bash
cd frontend/capify-mobile
npx expo start
```

**Then open the app and:**
1. ✅ Homepage loads
2. ✅ Tap guest button → Goes to expense tracker  
3. ✅ Tap back button → Returns to homepage
4. ✅ Navigation works both ways

If the back button still doesn't work, the issue might be:
- **Router configuration** in _layout.tsx
- **Navigation history** not being maintained
- **Touch handler** not firing properly

**Let me know what you see in the console and I can help debug further!** 🔍
