## 🎯 **Next Steps for Phase 3**

When implementing Phase 3 (Multi-user & Collaboration):

2. **Replace "Login" button** → Authentication screen
3. **Enable "Group Expenses" card** → Group management features
4. **Enable "Bill Splitting" card** → Splitwise-like functionality
5. **Add user profile** in header when logged in

## 🧪 **Testing the Homepage**

### **To Test:**
1. **Start the app** → Should land on new homepage
2. **Tap feature cards** → Navigate to respective sections
3. **Use back button** → Return to homepage from expense tracker
4. **Try quick actions** → All should lead to expense tracker (for now)
5. **Scroll through** → Smooth experience with all sections

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Homepage loads with gradient header
- ✅ Feature cards respond to taps
- ✅ Navigation works between screens
- ✅ Back button functions properly
- ✅ Coming soon cards show disabled state

This homepage creates a professional entry point for CapiFy and sets the foundation for the multi-user features in Phase 3! 🚀
